# app-and-file-search-k7 — brief

## Goal

A client can find installed applications, and files under configured roots,
and act on a selection. Application actions are launch or activate, reveal in
Finder, copy path and copy bundle identifier. File actions are open with the
default application, reveal, copy path and open in Zed.

## Done when

- Installed-application search returns the metadata these choices need.
  File search covers client-specified roots, currently the home directory.
  Results are bounded and ordering is stated; MRU ordering stays client-owned.
- An unavailable search mechanism, such as a disabled or missing index, is
  distinguishable from an empty result. Search reaches protected folders only
  as far as Koine's documented permissions allow, and says so.
- Selections act through `launch-and-open`'s operations. Clipboard writes
  follow `provider-architecture`'s allocation.
- Authority, trace rows and VM acceptance as in `launch-and-open`.

## Decomposition

1. `design` — the mechanism, with a bounded VM evidence check, and the API.
2. `planning` — cut implementation leaves.

## Notes

This extension deliberately lifts the desktop contract's exclusions of
non-running applications and broad discovery for these workflows only.
`provider-architecture` records the reconciliation this node relies on.
