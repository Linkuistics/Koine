# Koine architecture views

Open [the viewer](index.html#discussion) for the current discussion, outline and
SVG/source exports. The agreed future desktop contract now combines non-time
callback capture/expiry with public macOS Accessibility. The complete protocol
and implementation remain open; served-contract diagrams still describe the
existing timestamp API. The [spec](../../specs/machine.md#native-targeting-discussion)
and [ADR](../../adr/desktop-automation-uses-public-accessibility.md) are authoritative.

The scope change accepts wrong-target data/effects during reuse, stale reports,
mistaken reference withdrawal and framework AX reception without Koine's hard
acquisition bound, including resource pressure or failure. Capture-transfer has
separate acquisition obligations. Grants, Koine-owned consent, known-dead capture
refusal, permanent local withdrawal/non-reuse and bounded own state/work remain.

## Current discussion

- [Targeting boundary](index.html#diagram-process-target-contract): separates
  retained capture/local guarantees from public AX's accepted limits.
- [Scope and remaining work](index.html#diagram-process-adoption): the private
  route is rejected for this deliverable; capture/transfer, lifecycle, public AX
  consent/ownership and full protocol agreement remain before implementation.
- [Capture location](index.html#diagram-process-capture): the client callback
  remains the capture boundary; actual right transfer is still a candidate.
- [Private admission conflict](index.html#diagram-process-receive-admission):
  keeps the bounded evidence and records the human's explicit scope decision.

The observation, wire, acquisition-budget and direct-endpoint views preserve
historical investigations. Their findings do not establish a complete native
observation exchange, and their unproved private guarantees are no longer release
gates. The [adoption synthesis](../../verification/ax-endpoint-adoption.md) and
[receive report](../../verification/native-observation-receive.md) retain the
measurements, limits and original criteria. The restoration view still informs
the unresolved AX-contact lifecycle decision; the serial view still explains
why PSN plus boot identity cannot provide strict process lifetime.

Other views cover the resident application, source packages, served desktop
interaction, grants and provider ABI. Graphs begin at their marked start node;
sequences read top to bottom. Captions state evidence limits. No diagram is
formal verification or release acceptance.

## Sources and exports

`diagrams.json` owns introductions, captions, outline groups and discussion/update
markers. Each source has a version-controlled SVG. Regenerate exports from the
source, then inspect them; do not hand-edit SVG. The viewer fetches source and
exports on reload and does not compile them.

From the repository root:

```sh
task design:render-process-identity
task design:render-receive-admission
task design:render-receive-budget
```

These headless PlantUML tasks render SVG beside each source and PNG under
`.build/design-identity`; they do not run native diagnostics. The installed
renderer is PlantUML 1.2026.8. The other sources use D2 0.9.0 and Graphviz 16.1.0;
retain their existing renderer settings when changing them.

## Verification scope

Earlier native reports and their reproduction sections carry the frozen platform,
input, output and rendering records for those revisions. Earlier Safari checks
apply to their recorded bytes, not automatically to this update. k104 changes
requirements and presentation only; no new AX operation, consent test, capture
transfer or product acceptance run is claimed.

For k104, all three rendering tasks above completed successfully with unchanged
source/manifest/Taskfile/renderer-launcher inputs checked item by item. The seven
changed PNG exports were inspected for legibility and layout. Manifest IDs,
source/export paths, discussion/update references and SVG XML parsed successfully;
relative Markdown links and headings were checked with deliberately missing
file/heading controls. No fresh browser, narrow/mobile or dark-mode check was
performed for this update.
